"""Every fenced shell block in the docs pastes into a Mac's zsh as written.

In zsh, the Mac's own shell, `interactivecomments` is off at the prompt, so a
pasted `#` is a WORD, not a comment:

- `session list   # your sessions` runs `session list '#' your sessions`;
- an apostrophe in a comment (`# one session's window`) opens a quote that
  eats the lines pasted after it;
- `(in ...)` in a comment is a glob, and zsh stops on it.

So a command's explanation goes in the prose, never after the command. A `#`
line belongs only in a block the reader saves and runs as a script: one that
starts with a `#!` line. And every quote a block opens, it closes.

A value the reader types is an UPPERCASE word (`message send TO`), the word the
command's own help uses, never a `<word>`. Unquoted, `<box>` is a redirection
in zsh and in bash: the paste stops with "no such file or directory: box", or
a parse error, and the line does not run.

The guard reads each block as zsh does at the prompt, with no comments. It
covers every Markdown file in the repo (git's list when there is one, else a
walk of the tree, as in a release archive), except CHANGELOG.md, whose landed
bullets are never rewritten, and the test fixtures.
